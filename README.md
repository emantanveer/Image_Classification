# CIFAR-10 Image Classification using PyTorch 

This project involves building, training, and evaluating a deep learning model to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. CIFAR-10 is a widely used dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 classes, such as airplanes, automobiles, birds, cats, and more.

## Features

- **Dataset**: Uses the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains 50,000 training and 10,000 testing images across 10 classes.
- **Deep Learning Model**: Implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using PyTorch .
- **Training Pipeline**: Includes data preprocessing, model training, and loss/accuracy tracking.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluates the model on test data and displays classification accuracy.
- **Visualization**: Plots loss and accuracy curves for insights into model performance.
